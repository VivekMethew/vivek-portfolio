						Hi Everyone!! I'm Vivek Kumar from Aligarh (U.P.) India where I work as a Full Stack Web
						Developer at Chetu India Pvt. Ltd. I use JS-based technologies for my development process that
						heavenly includes Node.js. At the frontend, I prefer to React but I am also comfortable with Vue
						and Angular. I have been working for the last 2 years and wanna continue forever. I love coding,
						it's my profession, hobby, and passion. I would love to learn python in the future if I ever
						jump on ML and AI although I already tried Tensorflow.js in my current project and it works
						awesome with js. In my spare time, I üíó watching shows on Netflix. I am also a Youtuber where I
						post videos on all the latest games launch for the PC. So no to piracy, I try to buy all of
						them.
